## The London Aquatics Centre

This page is the results of a "Scavenger Hunt" for my *Architecture and Society* course. The ultimate goal
of the project was to find media and information relating to a certain building. The one that I chose was the
London Aquatics Centre, in well, London.

Designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid, the London Aquatics Centre was orginally built for the 2012
London Olympics games[^1]. The centre has been busy even after the conclusion of the Olympics. Today, it hosts
various events such as swimming classes, community events, and the occasional sporting competition[^2].

<div style="font-size:smaller">
For the Olympic Games, the LAC was expanded with two additional side wings. These wings increased the total seating of the centre to 17000, about 8 times it's normal capacity.
After the Olympics, the extra seating was removed, and now windows are in their place.
