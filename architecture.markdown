# The London Aquatics Centre

This page is the results of a "Scavenger Hunt" for my *Architecture and Society* course. The ultimate goal
of the project was to find media and information relating to a certain building. The one that I chose was the
London Aquatics Centre, in well, London.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast Facts [1]</p>
<ul>
 <li>Name: London Aquatics Centre</li>
 <li>Location: London, England</li>
 <li>Architect: Zaha Hadid</li>
 <li>Constructed: 2011</li>
 <li>Area: 15950 m^2</li>
</ul>

<br/>

Designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid, the London Aquatics Centre was orginally built for the 2012
London Olympics games[^1]. The centre has been busy even after the conclusion of the Olympics. Today, it hosts
various events such as swimming classes, community events, and the occasional sporting competition[^2].

<div style="font-size:smaller">
I "visited" the London Aquatics Center using Google Earth VR (See screenshot in the gallery). From there you can see that the LAC and the Olympic park is situated inside in a patch
of greenery inside of the urban landscape of London. Just across a river is a the main Olympics stadium, as well a massive red sculpture.

Interior Paranorma

<div style="font-size:smaller">
For the Olympic Games, the LAC was expanded with two additional side wings. These wings increased the total seating of the centre to 17000, about 8 times it's normal capacity.
After the Olympics, the extra seating was removed, and now windows are in their place.

## Online and In Media
[A journal article about the Centre](https://www.architectmagazine.com/project-gallery/london-aquatics-centre-397)
<br/>
The London Aquatics Center was built perpindicular and right next to the Stratford City Bridge, which was the main connection into the Olympic park. Because of this
the Centre was the first thing visitors would see of the park. As such, a lot of effort was made into designing it as it was the first impression visitors would have. The
Centre actually hosts three different pools. The main competition pool, and smaller diving pool, and finally a training pool located on a lower level.[^3]

<br/>
[A website which features the Centre](https://www.arch2o.com/london-aquatics-centre-zaha-hadid-architects/)
<br/>
The website states that the London Aquatics Center was designed to mimic the motions of water and fit in with the river that it was built besides. I certainly agree
with this. The curved *shape* of the roof combined with its' smooth *texture* and white *color* make the building resemble a wave in water. It's very fitting for
a building dedicated to hosting aquatic sporting events [^4].

<br/>
[An article and obituary for the architect of the LAC, Zaha Hadid](https://www.easybib.com/project/style/mla8?id=1580503224_5e3490b87a0571.82573638)
<br/>
When Zaha Hadid first began her architecture career in the 1980s, most of the designing was still done on paper. However, soon various computer assisted design tools 
were developed, and these allowed her to create her unique flowing and fluid style. Hadid was also unique in that she designed many buildings outside of the west, with many
of her most famous works being located in China, Korea, and the Middle East[^5].

### An interview with Zaha Hadid on the LAC

{% include video id="mF0DPT1Xuyc" provider="youtube" %}

Zaha Hadid says that she was inspiried by fluids, and wanted to design a building that resembled a liquid. She wanted people to feel like they are free floating while
they are swimming in the pool. When you look up from inside the pool, she wanted the ceiling to look like the surface of the water, making it feel like you were still underwater.
Hadid closes by saying that she has spent a lot of time in East London, where the LAC is located, and is happy to see that it has grown into a bustling city.

### A timelapse video of activies inside Centre[^1]

{% include video id="176454186" provider="vimeo" %}

In this timelapse you can see that even after the Olympic games have ended, the London Aquatics Center remains a hub of activity. You can see exactly what goes on inside,
from family events to swimming lessons. You can also see the way *light* flows in through the large windows on either side of the building.
